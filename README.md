## Darwinia/Crab Network XCMP Cooperations

### Cooperation Process
**Contract our developers or fork this repository and do the following things:**
1. Edit the [`xcmp-coops.toml`](xcmp-coops.toml)
2. Find your cooperation target, Darwinia or Crab Network
3. Add an new item follow the existing items format
4. Make a pull request
5. Once the channel(s) was(were) established, the pull request will be merged

**Some formatting issues:**
1. If the field you don't used just leave with an empty string `""`
2. Convert your network's name to lowercase, e.g. `"Foo" -> "foo"`
3. Convert your network's name style to kebab-case, e.g. `"FooBar", "fooBar", "FOO_BAR", "foo_bar" -> "foo-bar"`
4. Replace the space in your network name with a dash, e.g. `"foo bar" -> "foo-bar"`
